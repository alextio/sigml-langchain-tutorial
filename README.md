# Setup Instructions
Need to do TWO things:
1. Run the following in the terminal after cloning the project
```python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # on macOs or Linux. On Windows, try 'venv\Scripts\activate'
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Get API keys for both OpenAI (using Kixlab's account; refer to Kixlab FAQs) and [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/).  Input the keys into the `.env` file in the root directory.
